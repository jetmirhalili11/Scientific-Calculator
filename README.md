# Scientific-Calculator

Because the application was developed with a simple IDE (jGrasp) I do not guarantee that it will work on other IDE's as well. Please do not change the names of files as that would make the application unstable.

All classes are written by me, so the ready code has not been received. I made this project a long time ago (when i started programing) so maybe the comments and the code are not as good as they must be.

The project uses 4 classes as seen in the picture below. The model is MVC (Model-View-Controller) where the "Controll" class is the controller part, the "Model" and "Calculate" classes are the model part and "Window" class is the view part.
